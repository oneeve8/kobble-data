# Markdown Notes

Click the pencil icon in your files to edit markdown in Kobble.  
The Markdown view is separated into two windows:  
the Markdown syntax is in the top window  
and the result appears in the bottom window.  
Both windows scroll down.  
(Toggle back to the paper icon to select result view only)
***

# Header

Use a \# hashtag and a space before the heading:  

Syntax Examples:  

H1 = \# Markdown Notes  
H2 = \## Markdown Notes  
(adding more hashtags makes headings smaller).  

Result Examples: 
## Markdown Notes (H2)
### Markdown Notes (H3)
#### Markdown Notes (H4)
