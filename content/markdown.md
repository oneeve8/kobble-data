# Markdown Notes

Click the pencil icon in your files to edit markdown in Kobble.  
The Markdown view is separated into two windows:  
the Markdown syntax is in the top window  
and the result appears in the bottom window.  
Both windows scroll down.  
(Toggle back to the paper icon to select result view only)
***

# Header

Use a \# hashtag and a space before the heading:  

Syntax Examples:  

H1 = \# Markdown Notes

H2 = \## Markdown Notes  

(adding more hashtags makes headings smaller).  

Result Examples: 
## Markdown Notes (H2)
### Markdown Notes (H3)
#### Markdown Notes (H4)

# Soft Break

A Soft Break adds a new line without a break. To add a Soft Break,
insert two spaces after each new line.  Since you will not be able to see spaces, we will use dots to represent the spaces in the Syntax example.

Syntax Example:  
Ordinarily, you would have to use a double return which results in a hard break space between each line, like this:

First Line

Second Line

Third Line

However, you may want your lines to appear without the space between them, so that is why you would want to use a soft break. This is the syntax for creating soft breaks with each dot representing a space:  
First Line..  
Second Line..  
Third Line..  

Result Example:  (this is actually how it will look)

First Line  
Second Line  
Third Line
***
# Italics

Use _ , or * (one underscore or asterisk before and after words),  
Syntax examples:  
\_italic words\_  
\*italic words\*

Result examples:  
*italic words*  
_italic words_ 

***

# Bold

Use __ or, ** (two underscores or asterisks before and after words),  

Syntax example:  
\_\_this is syntax using two underscores\_\_  
\*\*this is syntax using two asterisks\*\*

Result Example:  
__this is bolded using two underscores__  
**this is bolded using two asterisks**

You can combine them if you want both italic and bold
***


# Fenced code block
Use ```(forward quote before and after)

Syntax example:  
\```this is syntax for a code block\```

Result example:

```this is a code block```

Scratch = ~~ (two tildes before and after words), example:  
~~scratch this~~


Block quote = > before the quote, example:

As Mahatma Gandhi said:

> An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  

> An eye for an eye   
> only ends up making   
> the whole world blind.  

> If you keep writing, then the text automatically wraps for you. If it is long enough it will wrap, so just keep writing to see what it will look like. You do not have to use the return key.

Link = [website] (www.link.com), example:
[Wikipedia](en.m.wikipedia.org)

Horizontal rule =

(Three hyphens separated by spaces, three asterisks, or three underscores), example:

- - -

___


List = * for a bullet point, or just use numbers  
Indent and then use an asterisk * for a hollow bullet point

* eggs
* butter

1. Milk
2. Eggs

Backslash escapes allow for literal characters which would otherwise have meaning in Markdown formatting syntax, example:

\*star\*

For emojis, use a colon before and after.  

 +1, tada, metal, sparkles
:+1: :tada: :metal: :sparkles:
