Prayers of the Holy Rosary  
The Our Father:  

Our Father who art in Heaven,  
Hallowed be thy name  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done  
On earth as it is in heaven  
Give us this day our daily bread  
And forgive us our tresspasses  
As we forgive those who tresspass against us  
And lead us not into temptation  
But deliver us from evil  
Amen.
