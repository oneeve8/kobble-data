# Basic Information


I. Debunking *false proofs*

II. Positive Evidence:

1. Empirical
		observation, 
		experimentation
2. Mathematical (Not proof, but supports empirical)
3. Logic and Reasoning (not proof but it must make logical sense)
4. 3D scale model or computer modelling (Not proof by itself, but must work on a small scale)
5. Expert Witness Testimony
6. Photographic or Video Evidence
