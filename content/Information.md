# Basic Information

What are we trying to prove?

We are trying to prove whether our earth and cosmos is:

1. Spherical or flat?   
2. Spinning or stationary?   
3. Heliocentric or Geocentric?
4. Has distant celestials or close celestials?
5. Is based on gravity or electromagnetism, density/buoyancy?
6. Is open or enclosed?
7. Is infinite or limited?
8. Is created by an intelligence or is a cosmic accident?
9. And we are trying to prove which of the various possible models is correct.

Two types of arguments:

I. Debunking evidence

II. Providing Positive Evidence

Types of evidence:

1. Empirical
		observation, 
		experimentation
	(Can serve as positive evidence if supported by other evidence)
2. Mathematical (not proof by itself, but supports empirical)
3. Logic and Reasoning (not proof by itself, but it must make logical sense)
4. 3D scale model or computer modelling (not proof by itself, but must work on a small scale model)
5. Expert Witness Testimony (not proof by itself, but can provide added certainty)
6. Photographic or Video Evidence (not proof by itself, but can provide added certainty)

All these together provide a *Preponderance of Evidence* which adds certainty to a hypothesis being true upon which one can build a theory.

A lack of evidence causes loss of certainty of a hypothesis being true.

*Over time, if the original hypothesis is overwhelmingly supported by the greater scientific community, and if no experiments have proven it wrong, it becomes a theory. It is important to keep in mind that a theory is the best explanation of a phenomenon using the data that is currently available.*

Acceptance, assumption, axiom, certainty, conclusion, conjecture, conviction, deduction, theorem, theory, guess, hypothesis, postulation, presumption, presupposition, supposition, opinion

Belief: assumption, credo, creed, doctrine, dogma, ideology, principle, precept.

credence: belief in or acceptance of something as true.

What is the difference between belief and knowing with certainty?

Belief: relying on others rather than yourself for information; or you lack knowledge or information, but you are relying on what information you have to formulate enough reason to base your world view upon it.

Knowing: You have experienced it, observed it, and tested it for yourself

Belief requires trust in others: 
You can trust others- You trust information is coming from a source that is trustworthy based on prior experience with a person or their work. You trust that the person or information is unbiased and objective.

Knowledge requires trust in yourself- You have experienced it, observed it, and tested it for yourself. You trust that your own motive is unbiased and objective.

Faith: Faith is different than belief. Faith is trusting in Divine Providence or a Divine being, or a Divine Order that is protecting and revealing truths. Faith does not require full trust in other humans or even trust in oneself. It is knowing that humans, including oneself, cannot fully be trusted, but one has faith that all truth will be revealed anyway despite ourselves, if we have good will in seeking the truth.
 
Why do we want to know?
Because a correct understanding of the design of our world provides a basis from which other truths are derived. A correct understanding of our place and purpose in the cosmos is the foundation to all our other philosophies, beliefs or world view.  It provides a foundation upon which to discern and make other decisions about the direction and purpose of our own lives; as well as our ability to help others live more fulfilling and purposeful lives.
