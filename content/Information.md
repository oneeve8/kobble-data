# Basic Information

What are we trying to prove?

We are trying to prove whether our earth and cosmos is:

I. Spherical or Flat?   
II. Spinning or Stationary?   
III. Has Distant Celestials or Close Celestials?
IV. Is open or enclosed?
V. Is infinite or limited?

Two types of arguments:

I. Debunking a *false proofs* of an alternative model

II. Providing Positive Evidence:

1. Empirical
		observation, 
		experimentation
	(Serves as positive evidence)
2. Mathematical (Not proof, but supports empirical)
3. Logic and Reasoning (not proof but it must make logical sense)
4. 3D scale model or computer modelling (Not proof by itself, but must work on a small scale model)
5. Expert Witness Testimony (Not proof, but can provide added certainty)
6. Photographic or Video Evidence (Not proof, but can provide added certainty)

All these together provide a *Preponderance of Evidence* which gives credence to a theory or hypothesis.
