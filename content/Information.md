# Basic Information


I. Debunking *false proofs*

II. Positive Evidence:

1. Empirical
		observation, 
		experimentation
2. Mathematical (supports empirical)
3. Logic and Reasoning (makes logical sense)
4. 3D scale model or computer modelling (works on a small scale)
5. Expert Witness Testimony
6. Photographic or Video Evidence

False Proofs:

I. Flat or Curved earth surface?   
II. Spinning or Stationary?   
III. Spherical, Spinning & distant celestials or Flat, Stationary, & close celestials?
