# Basic Information

What are we trying to prove?

We are trying to prove whether our earth and cosmos is:

I. Spherical or flat?   
II. Spinning or stationary?   
III. Heliocentric or Geocentric?
IV. Has distant celestials or close celestials?
V. Is open or enclosed?
V. Is infinite or limited?
VI. Is created by an intelligence or is a cosmic accident?
VII. And we are trying to prove which of the various possible models is correct.

Two types of arguments:

I. Debunking evidence of a particular model

II. Providing Positive Evidence for a particular model:

Types of evidence:

1. Empirical
		observation, 
		experimentation
	(Can serve as positive evidence if supported by other evidence)
2. Mathematical (not proof by itself, but supports empirical)
3. Logic and Reasoning (not proof by itself, but it must make logical sense)
4. 3D scale model or computer modelling (not proof by itself, but must work on a small scale model)
5. Expert Witness Testimony (not proof by itself, but can provide added certainty)
6. Photographic or Video Evidence (not proof by itself, but can provide added certainty)

All these together provide a *Preponderance of Evidence* which gives credence to a theory or hypothesis.
