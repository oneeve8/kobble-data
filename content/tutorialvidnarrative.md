## Welcome to Kobble
In this tutorial you will learn how to add channels, tracks and items; move and delete items; how to create a Markdown file; how to create a presentation file; and how to create a folder.

On your Kobble home page, you will notice some sample channels. Just tap and drag. Another way to add a sample channel is to tap the channel you want to add, dismiss the pop up message, long tap a channel in the data tree and select paste.

The Kobble tree is organised into channels, tracks and items. you can organise them however you want and expand and contract them as needed.

To create your own channel, click the plus sign next to Channels in your tree. Enter an ID for Github storage, a title, and a subtitle, then tap done. The owner and Repository information is defaulted.

Next you can add a track. Tracks simply contain items that you want to keep track of. Add a track by tapping the plus sign next to the channel you just added. Type in your ID, title and subtitle, then tap done.

Your new track will appear in your tree.

Next I’ll show you how to drag and drop a link. Kobble takes advantage of the iPad’s multi tasking features.

Swipe upwards from the bottom of your screen, tap and hold your browser and drag it to open a small window. Now you can browse the internet to find information that you want to add.

Simply tap and drag the URL into your Kobble tree. If you need to change the title of your link, simply long tap the link, select edit and change your title.

Next I’ll show you how to delete and move items in your tree.

Select Edit on the top left of your tree.
Select the item you want to delete and tap the delete button.

To move an item, select edit, then tap and drag the triple bar on the right. You can also move tracks. Items can also be moved in the same way. So you can organise your channels tracks and items however you want.

Next I’ll show you how to create a Markdown file. Select the plus sign next to the track you want to add a Markdown file to. The default item type is Markdown. Add your title, subtitle and ID. 

Markdown is an easy to use syntax and is easily converted to HTML. Markdown is intuitive, uses plain text and provides basic formatting. Tap the pencil icon in your Kobble view to edit and start typing. 

Your split screen view shows Markdown on the top half, and the result in the bottom half of your screen. 

Be sure to check out our Markdown cheat sheet if you need help with Markdown syntax.

Toggle between the pencil and square icon to change your view. 

As you can see, your results appear as you type.


Next I’ll show you how to create a presentation. Click the green plus sign next to the channel where you want your presentation file. Select presentation as your item type. Enter your title, subtitle and ID. Each slide is separated by a triple colon before and after each slide

Just type the information you want on each slide and use the green arrow to advance your slides.

Here is a slide presentation with images of Mark Twain.

Next I’ll show you how to create a folder. Creating a folder is simple, all you need to do is select folder as your item type, enter your title and subtitle. Folders can help you consolidate your work

Notice the top bar in your Kobble view has tabs open as you work. You can keep them open or close them as needed. 

Just one more thing to help you get started. Be sure to take advantage of your iPad’s multi-tasking features. After opening a window view, swipe from the top down to split your screen. use the center bar to narrow or widen your view. Swipe from left to right to remove the window.
