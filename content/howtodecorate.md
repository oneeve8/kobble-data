## How To

Ideas to help people style their home:

Getting Started: Simplify, Organize, Arrange.... Renew (acronym spells SOAR)
SOAR because getting things simple, organised and arranged in a way that inspires you, helps you to get settled in your nest and yet inspires you to fly to new heights with your creativity and productivity.

 (Add “renew” because after arranging, we always want to rearrange or add some thing new so we don’t get bored. Sorry if I’m throwing a monkey wrench into your simplicity of the 3)

Simplify: Toss, Upcycle, Repurpose, Need (TURN)
TURN because you are turning things into something new, giving things a second chance, or turning it away

T. oss - If you haven’t used it, either give it away, or throw it away
U. pcycle - Things needing your time or talent... can you fix it? Can you make it more useful? Can you craft it into something new?
R. epurpose - Things not requiring your time that you hadn’t used for its intended purpose, but that could be easily used for another purpose
N. eed - Things that you definitely want to keep, they serve their purpose, and you definitely use it sometimes or every day.

Organize: Placement, Interest, Necessity, Storage (PINS)
PINS because you are pinning it down to the essentials

P. lacement- Everything in its place and a place for everything
I. nterest - Keep items where they are used and needed
N. ecessity - Keep things that are needed handy
S. torage - Use excellent storage solutions

Arrange: Furniture, Form, Function, Flair (four Fs) 
Fs Because you are fabulous?

Furniture - The best pieces, and the best placement of your furniture for the size and shape of the room
Form - Arranging according to rules of style (rule of 3s, the height of pictures at eye level, aesthetic arrangement of pictures on a wall)
Function - Placement of furniture and decor items according to the function of that piece
Flair - Adding your personal style to your decor and its arrangement

FINDING STYLE:

Style: Setting, Personality, Lifestyle, Accentuate, Stuff, Heritage (SPLASH)
SPLASH because you are making a splash with your awesome style!
