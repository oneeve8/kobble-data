What is consciousness...?


I think we live in a Temporal Realm.

We are just here temporarily.

*Temporal* = time

*Realm* = kingdom, sovereign state, domain, sphere, area, field, department, arena

Temporal Realm. I think it is a good enough description... what do you think?

This is a limited realm of existence.

It has boundaries, set limits, it is defined by a mind or consciousness. Brought into being by an intelligence, ordered by an inte

Who is this Divine Intelligence? Many people have different ideas of who or what this consciousness is. There are many different religions.

Maybe there are *worlds* or *realms* or *heavens* beyond our realm.

I believe so... Do you?

Once something is defined, it begins to have substance and purpose. The border of a defined reality is the *edge* of reality. Things that are not yet defined are what set the limits between this realm and the realm of possibilities. Perhaps *out there* it is simply a gelatinous, nebulous collection of potentialities.

This world began with the naming of things by a conscious beingâ€” a human being.

A matrix or world can be built around an idea or ideas. 

Things brought into being and given a name. Classified, differentiated.

We think our world has to make logical sense. 

We want life to have a story.

We love stories, especially those with a challenge and a happy ending.

But does it? Does it make logical sense?

Does it necessarily *have* to make logical sense?

We are spiritual beings dwelling in a physical body.

We placed limits on our spiritual being-ness by coming into this realm.

Perhaps this realm is a creation of our own consciousness.

Again, what is consciousness?

Is consciousness of the mind or beyond the mind?

Perhaps this realm is a collaborative work of consciousness agreement.

Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious.

Hypnosis sessions that tap into the subconscious mind reveal the complexity of the human mind. Some people think that these stories reveal *past lives*

Other people believe we only live *one life*

They believe we have one chance to get it right.

What if time is not what we think it is?

What if there is no *time* as we understand it?

Or what if time is not actually linear?

What if everything is a symbol, a metaphor?
