## Speculation On Tree Of Knowledge

We live in a Temporal Realm.

We are just here temporarily.

This is a limited realm.

perhaps it is a creation of our own mind.

Or a collaborative work of consciousness agreement.

Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious.

Hypnosis sessions that tap into the subconscious mind reveal the complexity of the human mind. Some people think that these stories reveal *past lives*

Other people believe we only live *one life*

They believe we have one chance to get it right.

What if time is not what we think it is?

What if there is no *time* as we understand it?

What if everything is a symbol, a metaphor?
