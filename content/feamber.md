# Post Flat Earth: What I have been up to and the crazy things I have been thinking about.
## 

I have been following my intuition.

I had an inclination to do a puzzle.

So I got a puzzle from a second hand shop, I had not done one in a while. [picture of puzzle] my daughter wanted to save it, so we glued it to cardboard and used mod podge to hold it together. Now I’m collecting pebbles from the beach as sort of a mosaic border.

It was a hard puzzle, but it became an obsession to finish it. I thought to myself: *why am I wasting my time doing this*? But for some reason, I had to complete the puzzle even though I felt like I was procrastinating on other things. 

Then I realised there were online puzzles. So I got obsessed with those for a while.

I realised through my temporary obsession, that a puzzle is a good metaphor for solving problems. It is a good metaphor for life. A puzzle is easier to do if you find all the edges first. It really helps to define your borders. Then you put all the pieces into piles by Color and then by shape. You can only see the whole picture, once you fit all the pieces together. Once you get toward the end of finishing a puzzle, it goes a lot faster. And finishing it, gives you a certain sense of satisfaction of accomplishment.

I think we live in a Temporal Realm. [flammarion engraving]

We know that we are just here temporarily... because death is a reality. [gravestone]

And we know it is a sort of *place*

*Temporal* = time

*Realm* = kingdom, sovereign state, domain, sphere, area, field, department, arena

So, it is a *Temporal Realm*. I think it is a pretty good description.

This is a limited realm of existence.

Whatever it is, we do not have full knowledge about it. We do not have a full understanding of the edge (whether it exists or not and if it does where it is). We also do not have a complete picture of this realm and what it is all about. So we are limited in our knowledge and understanding about our existence. And this is whether you consider a flat earth model or the standard globe model.

When we don’t have full and complete knowledge about something... we call this a:

BELIEF

Because it requires a leap of consciousness to consider what it *IS* while actually not knowing what it is for sure. And then coming to that temporary conclusion that fits what else we know about our reality... and then basing our world views on that paradigm... all based on assumptions. Whether we like it or not, what we think we know... is a belief *system*.

A belief system can have various degrees of certainty by the believer, but it may never be a proven fact. We may never have full knowledge, because we are limited. Our human brains are limited from containing all the knowledge that there is.

If this realm does have boundaries, perhaps it is only defined by our own consciousness. I think that it was definitely brought into being by an intelligence, ordered by an intelligence, defined by an intelligence. And it must be an intelligence that is beyond our own intelligence. Because, as far as I know, no human being can create a world like this. I can only imagine that the intelligence that designed this world is far beyond any human intelligence. 
I would call this intelligence *divine* because it is beyond what I can personally comprehend or know. An atheist would try to deny this fact, but he must eventually come to the conclusion that beyond an intelligence that we can consider must be another intelligence that created *it*

Argument of causation or the First cause argument: in philosophy, is the self created being to which every chain of causes must ultimately go back. Which Aristotle called the “Prime mover” that is thought to be a deity of “pure form”. This same argument was also considered by the Christian theologian St. Thomas Aquinas as proof of God in the Christian tradition.

What is consciousness...? [picture of a brain] 

Does consciousness have a limit? [Picture of a Brain opening]

Maybe the only limit is our imagination.

Maybe there are *worlds* or *realms* or *heavens* beyond this realm. [image of heavenly realms]

John 14:2 *In my Father’s house are many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?”

Instead of the word *rooms*, other translations use the words Dwelling places, or mansions.

So, where is the edge of our realm? We have not found it yet. Neither in mainstream science or our flat earth cosmology model. Not knowing about where the edge is, or even if there is one, limits our comprehension about where we are, and how to fill in the missing pieces.

Once something is defined, it begins to have substance and purpose. The border of a defined reality is the *edge* of reality. Things that are not yet defined are what set the limits between this realm and the realm of possibilities. Perhaps *out there* it is simply a gelatinous, nebulous collection of potentialities.

Perhaps this world did begin with the naming of things by a conscious being— a human being.

A matrix or world of ideas can be built around a particular idea or ideas. 

Things are brought into being out of the *void* and given a name. Classified, differentiated by a consciousness.

We think our world has to make logical sense. 

We want life to have a story.

We love stories, especially those with a challenge and a happy ending.

But does it? Does it make logical sense? Does our story make sense?

Does it necessarily *have* to make logical sense?

When you have a dream, does it make sense? I have had a lot of nonsensical dreams. While I am in the dream, everything seems to make perfect sense. When I wake up, it no longer does make sense. Dreams are full of symbolism and metaphor.

When volunteers are placed under hypnosis, they come up with all kinds of stories that seem to make logical sense... and some that do not. I have been watching hypnosis sessions by 

Maybe we are in a dream.

Maybe we are in a dream and the real world is out there... somewhere.

What is *real*?

We are spiritual beings dwelling in a physical body.

Maybe we placed limits on our infinite spiritual being-ness by coming into this realm. Maybe we decided to play a part in the story.

All the world is a stage...

Perhaps this realm is a creation of our own consciousness. We call it *reality* but maybe it is no more of a *reality* than the dream world is.

Again, what is consciousness?

Is consciousness of the mind or beyond the mind?

Perhaps this realm is a collaborative work of consciousness agreement.

Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious.

Hypnosis sessions that tap into the subconscious mind reveal the complexity of the human mind. Some people think that these stories reveal *past lives*

Other people believe we only live *one life*

They believe we have one chance to get it right.

What if time is not what we think it is?

What if there is no *time* as we understand it?

Or what if time is not actually linear?

What if everything is a symbol, a metaphor? What if life is just one big lesson...

A lesson in love.

If we learn to love, is there any reason to come back?

I say no
