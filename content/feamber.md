What is consciousness...?


I think we live in a Temporal Realm.

We are just here temporarily.

*Temporal* = time

*Realm* = kingdom, sovereign state, domain, sphere, area, field, department, arena

Temporal Realm. I think it is a good enough description... what do you think?

This is a limited realm of existence.

It has boundaries, set limits, it is defined by a mind or consciousness. Brought into being by an intelligence, ordered by an intelligence, defined by an intelligence. People do not like the word God anymore. Its loaded with preconceived ideas and religious dogma. Lets call this intelligence *divine* for now.

Who is this Divine Intelligence? Many people have different ideas of who or what this consciousness is. There are many different religions.

Maybe there are *worlds* or *realms* or *heavens* beyond our realm.

I believe so... Do you?

Where is the edge?

Once something is defined, it begins to have substance and purpose. The border of a defined reality is the *edge* of reality. Things that are not yet defined are what set the limits between this realm and the realm of possibilities. Perhaps *out there* it is simply a gelatinous, nebulous collection of potentialities.

This world began with the naming of things by a conscious beingâ€” a human being.

A matrix or world can be built around an idea or ideas. 

Things are brought into being out of the *void* and given a name. Classified, differentiated by a consciousness.

We think our world has to make logical sense. 

We want life to have a story.

We love stories, especially those with a challenge and a happy ending.

But does it? Does it make logical sense? Does our story make sense?

Does it necessarily *have* to make logical sense?

When you have a dream, does it make sense? I have had a lot of nonsensical dreams. While I am in the dream, everything seems to make perfect sense. When I wake up, it no longer does make sense. Dreams are full of symbolism and metaphor.

When volunteers are placed under hypnosis, they come up with all kinds of stories that seem to make logical sense... and some that do not. I have been watching hypnosis sessions by 

Maybe we are in a dream.

Maybe we are in a dream and the real world is out there... somewhere.

What is *real*?

We are spiritual beings dwelling in a physical body.

Maybe we placed limits on our infinite spiritual being-ness by coming into this realm. Maybe we decided to play a part in the story.

All the world is a stage...

Perhaps this realm is a creation of our own consciousness. We call it *reality* but maybe it is no more of a *reality* than the dream world is.

Again, what is consciousness?

Is consciousness of the mind or beyond the mind?

Perhaps this realm is a collaborative work of consciousness agreement.

Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious.

Hypnosis sessions that tap into the subconscious mind reveal the complexity of the human mind. Some people think that these stories reveal *past lives*

Other people believe we only live *one life*

They believe we have one chance to get it right.

What if time is not what we think it is?

What if there is no *time* as we understand it?

Or what if time is not actually linear?

What if everything is a symbol, a metaphor? What if life is just one big lesson...

A lesson in love.

If we learn to love, is there any reason to come back?

I say no
