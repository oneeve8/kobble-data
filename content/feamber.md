# Post Flat Earth: What I have been up to and the crazy things I have been thinking about.
## 

I’ve been following my intuition.

I had an inclination to do a puzzle.

So I got a puzzle from a second hand shop, I had not done one in a while. [picture of puzzle] my daughter wanted to save it, so we glued it to cardboard and used mod podge to hold it together. Now I’m collecting pebbles from the beach as sort of a mosaic border.

It was a hard puzzle, but it became an obsession to finish it. I thought to myself: *why am I wasting my time doing this*? But for some reason, I had to complete the puzzle even though I felt like I was procrastinating on other things. 

Then I realised there were online puzzles. So I got obsessed with those for a while.

I realised through my temporary obsession, that a puzzle is a good metaphor for solving problems. It is a good metaphor for life. A puzzle is easier to do if you find all the edges first. It really helps to define your borders. Then you put all the pieces into piles by Color and then by shape. You can only see the whole picture, once you fit all the pieces together. Once you get toward the end of finishing a puzzle, it goes a lot faster.

What is consciousness...? [picture of a brain] 

Does consciousness have a limit? [Picture of a Brain opening]

Maybe the only limit is our imagination.

I think we live in a Temporal Realm.

We know that we are just here temporarily... because death is a reality.

*Temporal* = time

*Realm* = kingdom, sovereign state, domain, sphere, area, field, department, arena

Temporal Realm. I think it is a pretty good description... what do you think?

This is a limited realm of existence.

It has boundaries, set limits, it is defined by a mind or consciousness. Brought into being by an intelligence, ordered by an intelligence, defined by an intelligence. An intelligence that is beyond our own intelligence. I would this intelligence *divine* because it is beyond what I can comprehend or know.

Maybe there are *worlds* or *realms* or *heavens* beyond this realm.

John 14:2 *In my Father’s house are many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?”

Instead of the word *rooms*, other translations use the words Dwelling places, or mansions

Where is the edge of our realm? We have not found it yet. Neither in mainstream science or our flat earth cosmology model. Not knowing about where the edge is, or even if there is one, limits our comprehension about where we are, and how to fill in the missing pieces.

Once something is defined, it begins to have substance and purpose. The border of a defined reality is the *edge* of reality. Things that are not yet defined are what set the limits between this realm and the realm of possibilities. Perhaps *out there* it is simply a gelatinous, nebulous collection of potentialities.

This world began with the naming of things by a conscious being— a human being.

A matrix or world can be built around an idea or ideas. 

Things are brought into being out of the *void* and given a name. Classified, differentiated by a consciousness.

We think our world has to make logical sense. 

We want life to have a story.

We love stories, especially those with a challenge and a happy ending.

But does it? Does it make logical sense? Does our story make sense?

Does it necessarily *have* to make logical sense?

When you have a dream, does it make sense? I have had a lot of nonsensical dreams. While I am in the dream, everything seems to make perfect sense. When I wake up, it no longer does make sense. Dreams are full of symbolism and metaphor.

When volunteers are placed under hypnosis, they come up with all kinds of stories that seem to make logical sense... and some that do not. I have been watching hypnosis sessions by 

Maybe we are in a dream.

Maybe we are in a dream and the real world is out there... somewhere.

What is *real*?

We are spiritual beings dwelling in a physical body.

Maybe we placed limits on our infinite spiritual being-ness by coming into this realm. Maybe we decided to play a part in the story.

All the world is a stage...

Perhaps this realm is a creation of our own consciousness. We call it *reality* but maybe it is no more of a *reality* than the dream world is.

Again, what is consciousness?

Is consciousness of the mind or beyond the mind?

Perhaps this realm is a collaborative work of consciousness agreement.

Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious.

Hypnosis sessions that tap into the subconscious mind reveal the complexity of the human mind. Some people think that these stories reveal *past lives*

Other people believe we only live *one life*

They believe we have one chance to get it right.

What if time is not what we think it is?

What if there is no *time* as we understand it?

Or what if time is not actually linear?

What if everything is a symbol, a metaphor? What if life is just one big lesson...

A lesson in love.

If we learn to love, is there any reason to come back?

I say no
