# Post Flat Earth: What I have been up to and the crazy things I have been thinking about.
## 

In this video, I will be sharing what I think about a creator God, the bible, what we can know about this realm. 

Lately, I have been following my intuition.

I had an inclination to do a puzzle.

So I got a puzzle from a second hand shop, I had not done one in a while. [picture of puzzle] my daughter wanted to save it, so we glued it to cardboard and used mod podge to hold it together. Now I’m collecting pebbles from the beach as sort of a mosaic border.

It was a hard puzzle, but it became an obsession to finish it. I thought to myself: *why am I wasting my time doing this*? But for some reason, I had to complete the puzzle even though I felt like I was procrastinating on other things. 

Then I realised there were online puzzles. So I got obsessed with those for a while.

I realised through my temporary obsession, that a puzzle is a good metaphor for solving problems. It is a good metaphor for life. A puzzle is easier to do if you find all the edges first. It really helps to define your borders. Then you put all the pieces into piles by Color and then by shape. You can only see the whole picture, once you fit all the pieces together. Once you get toward the end of finishing a puzzle, it goes a lot faster. And finishing it, gives you a certain sense of satisfaction of accomplishment.

Because of my background in literature, philosophy and studying religions around the world, I see a lot of things as metaphor. I learn from everything, and try to see the deeper meaning of why something is happening in my life or why my interests lead me in a certain direction... and what it all means. We are constantly seeking meaning in our lives.

I think we live in a Temporal Realm. [flammarion engraving]

We know that we are just here temporarily... because we know that death is a reality. [gravestone]

And we know it is a sort of *place*

*Temporal* = time

*Realm* = kingdom, sovereign state, domain, sphere, area, field, department, arena

So, it is a *Temporal Realm*. I think it is a pretty good description.

I think this place we are in This is a limited realm of existence.

Whatever it is, we do not have full knowledge about it. We do not have a complete picture of this realm and what it is all about. So we are limited in our knowledge and understanding about our existence. And this is true whatever cosmology model you happen to be considering. We do not know whether or not it has limits, what shape it is, or even what it looks like.

When we don’t have full and complete knowledge about something... we call this a:

BELIEF

Because it requires a leap of consciousness to consider what it *IS* while actually not knowing what it is for sure. And then coming to that temporary conclusion that fits what else we think we know about our reality... and then basing our world views on that paradigm... all based on assumptions. Whether we like it or not, what we think we know... is a belief *system*.

A belief system can have various degrees of certainty by the believer, that makes us THINK we know something with 100% certainty. But I would argue that in this realm that we find ourselves in, we can NEVER EVER know anything with 100% certainty. We may never have full knowledge, because we are limited. Our human brains have limited capacity. So, we are limited from containing all the knowledge that there is. So, at some point, we must come to that understanding and acquiesce that we will never know everything. We must conclude that some things will always remain a mystery. And I think its best to come to terms with that and be at peace with mystery.

For some people, they are satisfied with not knowing everything because they rely on other human beings who they think know things. And they think that their *puzzle pieces* seem to fit into sort of a picture that is starting to make sense.

For some other people, we started poking holes in that certainty of what we thought we knew. 

Some of us actually base our certainty of belief on faith in a higher power than ourselves who we think actually *DOES* know everything. And we also think our puzzle pieces seem to fit into some sort of picture that is starting to make sense.

I personally think that this world was brought into being by an intelligence, ordered by an intelligence, defined by an intelligence. 

It must be an intelligence that is beyond our own intelligence. Because, as far as I know, no human being can create a world like this. I can only imagine that the intelligence that designed this world is far beyond any human intelligence that I have ever encountered.

I would call this intelligence *divine* because it is beyond what I can personally comprehend or know. 

Richard Dawkins clip
An atheist would try to deny this fact, but he must eventually come to the conclusion that beyond any intelligence that we can consider, there must be *another* intelligence that created *it* and so on... up to a first intelligence.

This is the Argument of causation or the First cause argument: in philosophy, is the self created being to which every chain of causes must ultimately go back. Which Aristotle called the *Prime mover* that is thought to be a deity of *pure form*. This same argument was also considered by the Christian theologian St. Thomas Aquinas as proof of God in the Christian tradition.

I personally believe in a divine creator who knows us, loves us and can communicate with us. I personally believe this, because I have had personal experiences which I consider evidence through synchronicities or what I like to call divine providence in my life. If you have not had these experiences, I suggest you simply ask. 

Many of these providential things happen when I open the bible. I might contemplate a scripture in the bible, and then an event or circumstance in my life helps to explain its meaning. Or vice versa, an event or circumstance happens, and I open my bible and the scripture I read relates to it. 

But I am going to ask a question for those of you who have difficulty with the bible, (because I had difficulty with it too at first). If there is a divine being that exists, I would hope that this creator would have left us some sort of instructions about this place. Or maybe this creator would send us some messengers about this place too. We would like to have some sort of users manual. What do you think? Do you think that one might exist? If so, your search begins. I hope you eventually come to the same conclusion that I have after studying various religions. That the bible represents the most comprehensive history of our origins, some of the best advice, and the New Testament, through the sayings of Jesus represents the best and most certain path to the truth. At least, the best that is currently humanly possible. However, may you be blessed on your journey, wherever you may be starting, and wherever it may lead you.

This is where I would like to try to explain what I believe about the bible and other sacred texts and origin stories around the world. Maybe this will help you too. And maybe I will get a lot of comments back from Christians who disagree with me. It will be hard to explain without somebody thinking I am wrong. But here it goes anyway.

Science tries to answer the what is it and how is it. But it can never answer Why is it? We hope that somewhere in those sacred texts of the world are some answers to the questions we have been asking. Who are we? Where did we come from? And Why are we here? Most of these sacred texts couch truths in METAPHOR. Why? Because the real reality is beyond this realm. It is incomprehensible to us. Since all we know is this realm, we have no knowledge of how things truly are.

Jesus spoke about the kingdom of God in the form of PARABLE. A parable is like a metaphor. It explains the unexplainable by comparing it to things that are familiar. He always began His parables with “The kingdom of God is like...” 

And so, this is where I differ from other Christian believers (even though I respect and appreciate them very much) who speak about taking the bible as LITERAL. 

Because for me, it is completely obvious that the WHOLE WORLD IS A METAPHOR, so really NOTHING can be taken as quote *literal* even though it contains TRUTH. Even though historical events may or may not have actually happened in the bible just as they are told, they TOO are METAPHOR. Because all of life is a METAPHOR to explain the divine. Nothing in this world IS literal. All of creation serves only to point us to a realm beyond this realm... which is the kingdom of God.

If you don’t agree with me on this and you are a Christian. All I ask is that you be polite about it if you want to comment below. And just do me a favour and ask yourself Why do YOU think that most of what Jesus taught was told in parable form? What would be the purpose of that? If he could tell us literally what heaven is, why would he not just say it plainly? Why did Jesus only speak on heavenly things?

I think it is because all He wanted to do with all that he said is to direct our thoughts to spiritual things. He said, his kingdom is not of this world.

So, before Jesus came, the Old Testament mainly describes things all about this human world. Worldly things, worldly kings, imperfect people with an imperfect understanding of who God really is and what the heavenly kingdom is really like. So just think about that when you read the Old Testament and compare it with the New Testament.

What is consciousness...? [picture of a brain] 

Does consciousness have a limit? [Picture of a Brain opening]

Maybe the only limit is our imagination.

If this realm does have boundaries, perhaps it is only defined by our own consciousness.

Maybe there are *worlds* or *realms* or *heavens* beyond this realm. [image of heavenly realms]

John 14:2 *In my Fathers house are many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?*

Instead of the word *rooms*, other translations use the words Dwelling places, or mansions.

So, where is the edge of our realm? We have not found it yet. Neither in mainstream science or our flat earth cosmology model. Not knowing about where the edge is, or even if there is one, limits our comprehension about where we are, and how to fill in the missing pieces.

Once something is defined, it begins to have substance and purpose. The border of a defined reality is the *edge* of reality. Things that are not yet defined are what set the limits between this realm and the realm of possibilities. Perhaps *out there* it is simply a gelatinous, nebulous collection of potentialities.

Perhaps this world did begin with the naming of things by a conscious being... a human being.

A matrix or world of ideas can be built around a particular idea or ideas. 

Things are brought into being out of the *void* and given a name. Classified, differentiated by a consciousness.

We think our world has to make logical sense. 

We want life to have a story.

We love stories, especially those with a challenge and a happy ending.

But does it? Does it make logical sense? Does our story make sense?

Does it necessarily *have* to make logical sense?

When you have a dream, does it make sense? I have had a lot of nonsensical dreams. While I am in the dream, everything seems to make perfect sense. When I wake up, it no longer does make sense. Dreams are full of symbolism and metaphor.

When volunteers are placed under hypnosis, they come up with all kinds of stories that seem to make logical sense... they are stories. So, another binge session I have been on is watching hypnosis sessions by 

Hypnosis sessions that tap into the subconscious mind reveal the complexity of the human mind. Some people think that these stories reveal *past lives*. After watching several hours of these sessions, I have another take on this.

Maybe we are in a dream.

Maybe we are in a dream and the real world is out there... somewhere.

What is *real*?

We are spiritual beings dwelling in a physical body.

Maybe we placed limits on our infinite spiritual being-ness by coming into this realm. Maybe we decided to play a part in the story.

All the world is a stage...

Perhaps this realm is a creation of our own consciousness. We call it *reality* but maybe it is no more of a *reality* than the dream world is.

Again, what is consciousness?

Is consciousness of the mind or beyond the mind?

Perhaps this realm is a collaborative work of consciousness agreement.

Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious.



Other people believe we only live *one life*

They believe we have one chance to get it right.

What if time is not what we think it is?

What if there is no *time* as we understand it?

Or what if time is not actually linear?

What if everything is a symbol, a metaphor? What if life is just one big lesson...

A lesson in love.

If we learn to love, is there any reason to come back?

I say no
