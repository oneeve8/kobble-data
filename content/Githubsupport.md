## GitHub Support

[I mentioned this before, I still think that this part is ambiguous. So I’m going to try to explain why it would be confusing to someone reading it for the first time, if they don’t understand Kobble yet]

The free version of Kobble saves all data on your local device   

[This seems to imply or give the impression that the only free version available of Kobble is the one that saves your data on your local device. Are you going to allow people to use the public version of GitHub which is free?]

You can add GitHub support with an in app purchase. 

[here you say that GitHub support costs money. Someone not familiar with GitHub might think that GitHub costs money. Someone familiar with GitHub is going to know that a public GitHub account is free and be confused about this]

Just tap the Home button and select the GitHub tab.

If you enable GitHub support, all data is stored in your GitHub account.

Remember, you must have a GitHub account to enable GitHub support in Kobble, it’s free! 

[Here, you seem to be saying that GitHub support is free, or it could be ambiguous, is it the GitHub account that is free or the GitHub support that is free? Since the last thing you said is “enable GitHub support”. And then said, “it’s free” right after that, the person’s mind goes to the last thing that was said assuming that is what you are referencing

Since the very first line seems to imply that the only free version is the one that saves your info on your local device, this is confusing to now say that one of those ... either GitHub or GitHub support... is free. Also, I thought that a public account in GitHub is free and a private account costs money in GitHub]

Purchasing GitHub support enables sharing, one of the key features of Kobble. 

[So, here you are going back to saying that you have to purchase GitHub support again. So it just seems to take the person’s mind around in circles trying to figure out what you mean. It makes it seem like im getting the “run around”.]

***

Here is what I suggest:

(Assuming you are going to charge for either a free or public github account because that enables sharing, I would word it like this:)

The free version of Kobble saves all data on your local device. 

If you opt to purchase GitHub support, you will enable sharing in Kobble, and all of your data will be stored in GitHub.

Sharing is one of the key features of Kobble. To purchase GitHub support, just tap the Home button and select the GitHub tab.


(Assuming that you are going to have a free non github version and a free github version, I would word it differently)

Kobble is free if you opt to have your data stored on your own device, or you can opt to select a free public GitHub account.

Purchasing support enables sharing.

You could have a table:

Kobble 1 	[data stored on your computer] [no sharing]
Kobble 
If you opt for purchasing Kobble support, this will enable sharing in Kobble

With an in app purchase of GitHub support, all data is stored in your GitHub account. When you enable GitHub support, all data is stored in your GitHub account. GitHub support will also enable sharing, one of the key features of Kobble. Just tap the Home button and select the GitHub tab.
