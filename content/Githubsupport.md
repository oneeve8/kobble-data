## GitHub Support

The free version of Kobble saves all data on your local device   
You can add GitHub support with an in app purchase. (here you say that GitHub support costs money)

Just tap the Home button and select the GitHub tab.

If you enable GitHub support, all data is stored in your GitHub account.

Remember, you must have a GitHub account to enable GitHub support in Kobble, itâ€™s free! (Here, you seem to be saying that GitHub support is free, or it could be ambiguous, is it the GitHub account that is free or the GitHub support that is free? Also, I thought that a public account in GitHub is free and a private account costs money in GitHub)
Purchasing GitHub support enables sharing, one of the key features of Kobble.
