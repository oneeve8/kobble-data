## GitHub Support

I mentioned this before, I still think that this part is ambiguous. So I’m going to try to explain why it would be confusing to someone reading it for the first time, if they don’t understand Kobble yet)

The free version of Kobble saves all data on your local device   (This seems to imply that the only free version of Kobble is the one that saves your data on your local device. Are you going to allow people to use the public version of GitHub which is free?)

You can add GitHub support with an in app purchase. (here you say that GitHub support costs money)

Just tap the Home button and select the GitHub tab.

If you enable GitHub support, all data is stored in your GitHub account.

Remember, you must have a GitHub account to enable GitHub support in Kobble, it’s free! 

(Here, you seem to be saying that GitHub support is free, or it could be ambiguous, is it the GitHub account that is free or the GitHub support that is free? Since the first line seems to imply that the only free version is the one that saves your info on your local device, this is confusing. Also, I thought that a public account in GitHub is free and a private account costs money in GitHub)

Purchasing GitHub support enables sharing, one of the key features of Kobble. (So, here you are saying that you have to purchase GitHub support again)
