Ideas to help people style their home:

Getting Started: Simplify, Organize, Arrange.... Renew (acronym spells SOAR)
SOAR because getting things simple, organised and arranged in a way that inspires you, helps you to get settled in your nest and yet inspires you to fly to new heights with your creativity and productivity.

 (Add *renew* because after arranging, we always want to rearrange or add some thing new so we do not get bored. Sorry if I am throwing a monkey wrench into your simplicity of the 3)

Simplify: Toss, Upcycle, Repurpose, Need (TURN)
TURN because you are turning things into something new, giving things a second chance, or turning it away

T. oss - If you haven’t used it, either give it away, or throw it away
U. pcycle - Things needing your time or talent... can you fix it? Can you make it more useful? Can you craft it into something new?
R. epurpose - Things not requiring your time that you hadn’t used for its intended purpose, but that could be easily used for another purpose
N. eed - Things that you definitely want to keep, they serve their purpose, and you definitely use it sometimes or every day.

Organize: Placement, Interest, Necessity, Storage (PINS)
PINS because you are pinning it down to the essentials

P. lacement- Everything in its place and a place for everything
I. nterest - Keep items where they are used and needed
N. ecessity - Keep things that are needed handy
S. torage - Use excellent storage solutions

Arrange: Furniture, Form, Function, Flair (four Fs) 
Fs Because you are fabulous?

Furniture - The best pieces, and the best placement of your furniture for the size and shape of the room
Form - Arranging according to rules of style (rule of 3s, the height of pictures at eye level, aesthetic arrangement of pictures on a wall)
Function - Placement of furniture and decor items according to the function of that piece
Flair - Adding your personal style to your decor and its arrangement

FINDING STYLE:

Style: Setting, Personality, Lifestyle, Accentuate, Stuff, Heritage (SPLASH)
SPLASH because you are making a splash with your awesome style!

P. ersonality - MEET Modern, Earthy, Eccentric, Traditional
L. ifestyle - PART - Provincial (Rural family house), Apartment (space constrained, or temporary), Rustic (Farm life, or very casual), Town (City Life)
