# Tutorial Video Narrative
## #3
Hi, Welcome back to another Kobble tutorial video. This is tutorial number 3, you may want to check out our Introductory video and our other two tutorials before you view this video.

If you watched some of our other videos, 

By now, you probably have lots of ideas about how you want to use Kobble.

You might just want to do something as simple as keeping all your internet bookmarks organised.

You may want to organise and manage other kinds of content, such as archived books you want to read, research projects you are working on, or to do lists.

You may want to keep track of work related information, or personal information.

So, in this video, I will share some more content management ideas, such as creating folders and channel groups.

I will also show you how to cut and copy and paste items in your tree.

I will share some more ideas for creating your own projects or wiki knowledge base- for personal use, or as a student or teacher, or for work related projects.

I will also show you how to activate a GitHub account and explain a little more about GitHub, including how to retrieve and edit information in GitHub and the difference between a public and private repo.

I will also explain in more detail, your In-App sharing support option. And I will give you more details on sharing channels and tracks.

Lets get started.

Planning how you want to organise your work, might take a little thought. And each person likes to organise their information differently. That is why Kobble was designed to be as versatile as possible. So, if you change your mind, you can always copy or move anything where you want it.

Keep in mind that if you plan on activating sharing support, then your information in Kobble can be shared in groups of items contained in either a channel or a track.

There are also two more levels of organisation, a folder and a channel group. And I will explain what you may want to use these for.

***

To create a folder, tap the plus sign next to the track that you want your folder in. Select folder as your item type. Enter your title and subtitle. Now you can place multiple items in that folder, so you can consolidate them.

Tapping the folder will open or close it. The folder must be open in order to move content into it.

For example, I have several books by Aristotle that I want to group together among my great books list.

Folders will help you consolidate some of your items within a track.

Next I will show you the benefit of creating channel groups.

I want to keep my personal information separate from my work information, so I will create a channel group called work, and another one called home.

Select the home icon. Enter your new Channel Group name and tap done. Now I can put all my work related information in my new channel group. 

I can select or deselect the channel groups that I want to view in my tree. That way, when I am at work, I can focus on my work related channels. 

And when I am at home, I can focus on my personal channels.

If you plan on collecting a lot of information, you may want to consider creating several channel groups so you can simplify the amount of information that is in view at any given time in your tree.

Next I will show you how to cut, copy and paste.

If you want an item in more than one place, you can copy and paste it. Long tap the item you want to copy, then select the track you want it in, long tap it and tap paste.

In previous videos, I showed you how to delete and move while in edit mode. This is helpful if you plan on reorganising your channels, tracks and items.

But, if you just want to cut a single item quickly, there is another way to do it simply by long tapping the item and tapping cut. 

If you cut or copy, then the paste option will appear the next time you long tap. If you tap paste, the last item that you cut or copied will be pasted by tapping it.

Long tapping a:  
Item, reveals the options Cut Copy and Edit.  
Track, reveals the options Copy and Share.  
Channel, reveals the options to Cut Copy Edit or Share.

Now I am sure you are bursting with creativity of how you want to use Kobble. 

Here are some ideas.

You may want to keep your own recipes or links to recipes online.

If you are a student, you may want to keep track of your study notes, or even create a presentation that you could use as flash cards for memorising. You could create reports or a slide show for a speech presentation.

If you are a teacher, you could create a whole study unit on a particular topic with information that you want your students to read and learn. You could put your lecture notes on a slide presentation.

Or, if you are the type of person who just likes to collect all kinds of information, you may even want to create your own personalised knowledge base wiki.

***
Next I will show you how to activate a GitHub account

Your GitHub account contains all of your information, including all of your revisions.

I will quickly show you how to recover an item that you may have accidentally deleted that you decided you wanted to keep.

Instructions...

By the way, you can even edit information in GitHub rather than in Kobble if you want to.

There is a difference between a Public and and a Private repository in GitHub.


***

You learned in the Tutorial #2 how to share a channel or a track by tapping share, or by creating a follow me Markdown document that you can share.

When your recipient follows you,

They can simply drag and drop any channel or track links that you shared into their own Kobble tree if they want to.

You can continually add new channels and tracks to your own *Follow Me* Markdown file, and your recipients will always have your latest updates.

Your recipients will be able to view all your updates of information within each of your channels and tracks that you shared... as you update them. So you can share information even if it is a work in progress, they will always be able to view your most recent updates automatically.
