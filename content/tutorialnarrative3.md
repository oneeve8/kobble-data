# Tutorial Video Narrative
## #3
Hi, Welcome back to another Kobble tutorial video. This is tutorial number 3, you may want to check out our Introductory video and our other two tutorials before you view this video.

If you watched some of our other videos, 

By now, you probably have lots of ideas about how you want to use Kobble.

You might just want to do something as simple as keeping all your internet bookmarks organised.

You may want to organise and manage other kinds of content, such as archived books you want to read, research projects you are working on, or to do lists.

You may want to keep track of work related information, or personal information.

So, in this video, I will share some more content management ideas, such as creating folders and channel groups.

I will also show you how to cut and copy and paste items in your tree.

I will share some more ideas for creating your own projects or wiki knowledge base- for personal use, or as a student or teacher, or for work related projects.

I will also explain a little more about GitHub, including how to retrieve and edit information in GitHub and the difference between a public and private repo.

I will also explain in more detail, your In-App sharing support option. And I will give you more details on sharing channels and tracks.

Lets get started.

Planning how you want to organise your work, might take a little thought. And each person likes to organise their information differently. That is why Kobble was designed to be as versatile as possible. So, if you change your mind, you can always copy or move anything where you want it.

Keep in mind that if you plan on sharing your work with others, that your information in Kobble can be shared in groups of items contained in either a channel or a track.

However, there are two other levels of organisation, a folder and a channel group. And I will explain what you may want to use these for.

***

To create a folder, tap the plus sign next to the track that you want your folder in. Select folder as your item type. Enter your title and subtitle. Now you can place multiple items in that folder, so you can consolidate them.

For example, I have several books by Aristotle that I want to group together among my great books list.

I want to keep my private information separate from my work information, so I will show you how to create a channel group. Select the home icon. Enter your new Channel Group name and tap done. Im going to create a channel called work, and one called personal. 

 
In previous videos, I showed you how to delete and move while in edit mode. This is helpful if you plan on reorganising your channels, tracks and items.

But, if you just want to cut a single item quickly, there is another way to do it by long tapping the item and tapping cut. You can also copy items this way.

Long tap an item to reveal the cut copy and edit options.

Item: Cut Copy Edit
Track: Copy Share
Channel: Cut Copy Edit Share

If you cut or copy, then the paste option will also appear. If you tap paste, the last item that you cut or copied will be pasted by tapping it.

Another icon is a folder.
Tapping the folder will open or close it. The folder must be open in order to move content into  it.

Folders will help you consolidate some of your items within a track.

If you are like me, and you plan on collecting a lot of information, you will probably want to also consider consolidating your information into channel groups.

Under the Home icon, you can create a Channel group. This may come in handy if you are the type of person who likes to collect a lot of information for different reasons. For example, you can use this to separate your personal information from your work information. That way you can view only your work information while at work and your personal information while you are at home.

If you are a student, you may want to keep track of your study notes, or even create a presentation that you could use as flash cards for memorising. You could create reports or a slide show for a speech presentation.

If you are a teacher, you could create a whole study unit on a particular topic with information that you want your students to read and learn. You could put your lecture notes on a slide presentation.

Or, if you are the type of person who just likes to collect all kinds of information, you may even want to create your own personalised knowledge base wiki

When the recipient follows you,

They can simply drag and drop any channel or track links that you shared into their own Kobble tree if they want to.

You can continually add new channels and tracks to your own *Follow Me* Markdown file, and your recipients will always have your latest updates.

Your recipients will be able to view all your updates of information within each of your channels and tracks that you shared... as you update them. So you can share information even if it is a work in progress, they will be able to view your most recent updates automatically.
