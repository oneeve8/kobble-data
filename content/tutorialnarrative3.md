# Tutorial Video Narrative
## #3
Hi, Welcome back to another Kobble tutorial video.

If you’ve watched some of our other videos, 

by now, you probably have lots of ideas about how you want to use Kobble.

You might just want to do something as simple as keeping all your internet bookmarks organised.

You may want to organise and manage other kinds of content, such as projects and to do lists.

You may want to keep track of work related information, or personal information.

So, in this video, I’ll share some more content management ideas such as creating folders and channel groups.

I’ll also explain a little more about GitHub and your In

Another icon is a folder.
Tapping the folder will open or close it. The folder must be open in order to move content into  it

Under the Home icon, you can create a Channel group. This may come in handy if you are the type of person who likes to collect a lot of information for different reasons. For example, you can use this to separate your personal information from your work information. That way you can view only your work information while at work and your personal information while you are at home.

If you are a student, you may want to keep track of your study notes, or even create a presentation that you could use as flash cards for memorising. You could create reports or a slide show for a speech presentation.

If you are a teacher, you could create a whole study unit on a particular topic with information that you want your students to read and learn. You could put your lecture notes on a slide presentation.

Or, if you are the type of person who just likes to collect all kinds of information, you may even want to create your own personalised knowledge base wiki

When the recipient follows you,

They can simply drag and drop any channel or track links that you shared into their own Kobble tree if they want to.

You can continually add new channels and tracks to your own *Follow Me* Markdown file, and your recipients will always have your latest updates.

Your recipients will be able to view all your updates of information within each of your channels and tracks that you shared... as you update them. So you can share information even if it is a work in progress, they will be able to view your most recent updates automatically.
