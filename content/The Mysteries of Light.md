##### The Apostles' Creed
I believe in God the Father Almighty,   
Creator of heaven and earth;  
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;   
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died and was buried.  
He descended into hell;  
the third day He rose again from the dead;   
He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God,  
the Father Almighty;  
from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.    

*I believe the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.* 
Amen.

1st Mystery of Light  
Christ's Baptism in the Jordan  

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him; and a voice came out of the heavens: "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased." (Mark 1:9-10)

Hallowed be thy name.  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,  
On earth as it is in heaven.

*Give us this day our daily bread,  
And forgive us our tresspasses,  
As we forgive those who tresspass against us,  
And lead us not into temptation  
But deliver us from evil.*

The 2nd Mystery of Light 
The Wedding at Cana 

On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to teh wedding. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine." And Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come." His mother said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it." ... and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. (John. 2:1-5)

The 4th Mystery of Light  
The Transfiguration

Six days later Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. (Matt. 17: 1-3)

The 5th Mystery of Light  
The Institution of the Eucharist  

When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him. And He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." (Luke 22:14-16)

##### The Hail Holy Queen

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy,  
our life, our sweetness and our hope.    
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.  
To thee to we send up our sighs,  
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  
Turn, then, most gracious advocate,  
thine eyes of mercy toward us,  
and after this, our exile,  
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.  
Leader: *Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.*  
Response: *That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.*
:::
::: slide
Let us pray.   
O God, Whose Only-Begotten Son,     
by His life, death and resurrection, 
has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life: 
grant, we beseech Thee,   
that by meditating upon these mysteries   
of the most holy Rosary  
of the Blessed Virgin Mary,   
we may imitate what they contain,   
and obtain what they promise,   
through the same Christ our Lord.  

Amen.
