[show split screen and drag and drop a link]

As well as how to use multi tasking productivity features on the iPad as they relate to using Kobble.

The iPad has multitasking features that will help you increase your productivity. First I will show you how to create a split screen. 

## Split Screen

[start from a blank iPad screen then open up Kobble, Drag open an internet window and swipe down to establish the split windows] 

First open up Kobble, 
then swipe from the bottom of our screen to open up the application bar. 
Open up an internet browser window
Swipe from the top down to create a split screen. 
And there you go! 
That was easy!
You can adjust the width of your windows 
by grabbing the center and moving the width left or right
To go back to a single window simply swipe the window away.

## Drag and Drop

So say I am a Literature Teacher and I am creating a unit on Mark Twain. 

I have already created a Channel and some Tracks that I want to share with my students.

We have shown you how to create Channels and Tracks in our onboarding video, but in case you forgot, we will review that in a little bit.

So, First we will find a quote by Mark Twain and drag and drop it into Kobble.

[Search for quote by Mark Twain, drag and drop it into Kobble]

It is as simple as click, drag and drop

Did you know that you can stream an archived book in Kobble?

[Show a book streamed in Kobble]

## How to Stream a book in Kobble

First find the archived book you want to stream, 

Simply drag the link to Kobble.

You will need to modify the link slightly, by changing the word *__detail__* to *__stream__*

Now you can read the novel right in your Kobble environment. 

You can open and close it whenever you want. 

And The reader automatically saves your spot where you last left off.

While you are reading, you may want to take notes. 

So the next step I will show you is how to create a markdown file.

## How to create a Markdown file

Next I will show you how to create a Markdown file.

First click on a channel.

Then click on the plus sign of the Track you want to add your markdown file to.

The file type is defaulted to markdown, but if you click on file type, there you will see other file types.

Anyways, we are going to name our markdown file. 

And then create an Id that will be our reference of how it will be saved in GitHub.

Remember, I can always edit the names of my Channels and Tracks if I change my mind.

Now, Simply Click on the pencil on the top left of your Kobble view and start typing.

The result will appear in the bottom window.

You can toggle between the split screen Markdown view or Result view only.

If you are unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, don’t worry!

It is super easy and we have created a little cheat sheet for you.

One thing you may want to remember right away, is to double space at the end of each line where you want a soft break.  

And here, I just want to point out now that Kobble keeps what you have opened in tabs on top of your Kobble view screen. 

You can close and open them if you want to.

Did you know how easy it is to create a Presentation in Kobble?

## Creating a Presentation

Now that we have collected all our information that we are interested in about Mark Twain, we are ready to create a slide presentation for our Mark Twain unit to present to the class.

Simply click the plus sign in our Track again.

Select Presentation as our file type.

And name our file, and create an Id.

And then start typing!

The only difference from a regular markdown file and a presentation file, is that we need to present the information in smaller chunks and create individual slides.
To designate each slide, use three colons at the beginning and end of each slide.

Use the green arrows at the bottom of each slide to navigate your presentation.

You may want to insert pictures and videos into your presentation, so we will show you how to do that next.

## Pictures and Videos 

Keep in mind that you can drop links to images and videos from the internet into Kobble.

[show dragging and dropping video links and pictures]

But if you want to embed them into your Markdown presentation file, you can do that too!

I will show you how, and if you forget, simply refer back to the instructions in our Markdown notes file.

For an image, simply use an exclamation point before a set of brackets containing an image name that you designate, followed by parenthesis containing the image link.

For a video, simply use an @ at symbol before a set of brackets containing the video name that you designate, followed by parenthesis containing the video embed link. Make sure you are using the embed link.

Now that we have gathered quite a bit of information, we might want to reorganise it a little. Keeping everything organised just the way you want it is easy with Kobble.
***
## Organizing your data

I had collected a bunch of links about Mark Twain, and right now they are a bit disorganised.

So, I think I want to put all my quotes in one folder
So first I will create an folder item and name it Quotes.
Now I can drag and drop all my quotes into one folder.

I think I would also like to organise my information about the life of Mark Twain and keep that separate from his works.

You get the idea, it’s all just drag and drop.

I want to copy some of the information so I have it available in both tracks.

Next I want to create a new channel with just the information that I want to share with my friend Tammy so she can collaborate with me. She only needs my markdown file and my presentation file.

Tammy can collaborate through GitHub if I give her access to my file. We may want the final product to be a team effort. Or she can copy it into her own GitHub Repository. Another alternative is that she can copy it into her Kobble tree and work on it there and modify it just the way she wants to.

Now if I want to move a whole channel, I will need to tap Edit on the top left.

From there I can drag whole channels of information.

Just tap done when you are finished editing.

You can also delete items by sliding your items to the left to reveal the red delete button.

To delete whole channels, close all your tracks and tap edit at the top left of your data tree and tap the red button next to the Channel you want to delete.

Oops! I think I accidentally deleted something that I want to keep. 

Don’t worry, everything is backed up on GitHub. 

So, Next, we will show you how to retrieve information from GitHub.

## Retrieving information from GitHub
