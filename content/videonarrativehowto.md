In this video,
You will be given a brief introduction to Kobble

First I will show you how to drag and drop links from the internet into Kobble
As well as how to use multi tasking productivity features on the iPad as they relate to using Kobble.

The iPad has multitasking features that will help you increase your productivity. First I will show you how to create a split screen. 

## Split Screen, Drag and Drop

[start from a blank iPad screen then open up Kobble, Drag open an internet window and swipe down to establish the split windows] 

First open up Kobble, 
then swipe from the bottom of our screen to open up the application bar. 
Open up an internet browser window
Swipe from the top down to create a split screen. 
And there you go! 
That was easy!
You can adjust the width of your windows by grabbing the center and moving the width left or right

So say I am a Literature Teacher and I am creating a unit on Mark Twain. 

I have already created a Channel and some Tracks to share with my students.

We have shown you how to create Channels and Tracks in our onboarding video, but in case you’ve forgotten, we will review that in a little bit.

So, First we will find a quote by Mark Twain and drag and drop it into Kobble.

[Search for quote by Mark Twain, drag and drop it into Kobble]

It’s as simple as click, drag and drop

Did you know that you can stream an archived book in Kobble?

## How to Stream a book in Kobble

First find the archived book you want to stream, 
Drag the link to Kobble.

You will need to modify the link slightly, by changing [what word?] to “stream”

Now you can read the novel right in your Kobble environment. You can open and close it whenever you want. 

The reader automatically saves your spot where you last left off.

While you are reading, you may want to take notes. So the next step I will show you is how to create a markdown file.

## How to create a Markdown file

Next I will show you how to create a Markdown file.
First click on a channel, 
then click on the plus sign of the Track you want to add your markdown file to.
The file type is defaulted to markdown, but if you click on file type, there you will see other file types.
Anyways, we are going to name our markdown file. 
And create an Id that will be our reference of how it will be saved in GitHub.

Remember, I can always edit the names of my Channels and Tracks if I change my mind.
Now, Simply Click on the pencil on the top left of your Kobble view and start typing.
The result will appear in the bottom window.
You can toggle between Markdown view and Result view.
If you are unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, don’t worry!
It’s super easy and we’ve created a little cheat sheet for you.
One thing you may want to remember right away is to have a double space at the end of each line where you want a soft break.  


I just want to point out now that Kobble keeps what you’ve opened in tabs on top of your Kobble view screen. You can close and open them if you want to.

Now we will create a presentation.
Simply click the plus sign again
Select Presentation as our file type 
And name our file

Channel   
Track  
Track Item  
Markdown 
Presentation  
Folder  
Link  
Channel Group

You will also learn how to:

Cut, copy, move and delete Items  
And how to retrieve a lost item from your GitHub Repo



And you will learn how to:  
Drag items and links from the web to Kobble,  
Stream an archived book in Kobble,  

Finally,
You will also learn some basics on how to use Markdown,  
And how to create Presentation slides.

### Kobble allows you to organize the way you want to
Kobble allows you to create various items in a tree data format such as links, file folders, documents and slide presentations.
Kobble's unique tree data model contains Channels and what we call Tracks - which is simply a collection of these items relating to your projects that you want to keep track of.
You can create an unlimited number of Channels, Tracks and Items to organize your work. 

### Kobble has drag and drop features
The versatility of the Kobble tree format allows you to drag and drop easily so you can organize and rearrange your Channels, Tracks and Items however you want.
Another great feature of Kobble is that you can collect internet links easily by dragging and dropping them directly from the internet right into your Kobble Tracks. 
So, you can keep links organized where you need them, right alongside with other related information within your project Tracks.

### Kobble uses Markdown format
Documents and presentations in your Kobble environment are formatted using Markdown, an easy to use and versatile syntax format.  The benefits of Markdown is that it is platform independent, intuitive to use, uses plain text, provides basic formatting, and is easily converted to HTML.

### Kobble data storage using GitHub
Kobble stores all of your data on [GitHub](https://github.com) in *your personal account*. 
For those already familiar with GitHub, you will love this! Perhaps GitHub is new to other users, but you will soon see the benefits of having all your data stored and backed up so easily. 
You will have stress free storage with the security that your data is never lost. GitHub is easy to use and keeps everything updated as you edit. 
Your data can be edited, updated and controlled both through your personal GitHub account as well as through your personal Kobble environment. GitHub also keeps all of your revisions!

### Share and collaborate or keep it private with Kobble
Some people like privacy; some people like sharing and collaborating; and some people like a little of both. 
Kobble has the versatility for sharing as much or as little as you want. 
Your Kobble data can be stored in GitHub as a Secret Gist, a Private Repo, or a Public Repo.
All of your data is sent directly from your browser to GitHub, so it is never stored on our servers. 
Your data actually completely bypasses our servers, so if you choose to keep privacy, then nobody else ever sees any of your data unless you decide to make it public.
You can choose to keep your information private, and yet still easily share parts of it by sharing Channels of information with people who are interested in your work. 
Sharing Kobble Channels with people you are collaborating with on your projects is effortless. 
With Kobble, you always maintain control over your own data.

### Just imagine what you can do with Kobble
Just imagine how much more productive you will be by having control over how your data is collected, created, presented, stored and shared!
Kobble gives you mastery over all stages of your creative process and productivity: starting from the conception of your ideas; to gathering information; to then collaborating with others; up to the completion of your projects in a final presentation; and finally, to sharing your finished product with others. 
Once you see what you can do with Kobble, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
