### Folder problems
Created a folder and tried to move items into it
Could not drag and drop items into it
So tried cut and paste
The items seemed to cut and paste into the folder, but then
Strange things happened such as duplicate files created
Expanding and contracting caused extra copies to appear or disappear
Tried to delete extra copies and wrong files got deleted
Tried to copy and paste instead and that did not work either
I lost some files so 
Then I just decided to cut and paste the items into another track and start over.
