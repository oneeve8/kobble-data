### Couldn’t drop a link 
I was working on doing screen recordings for my next tutorial video. I deleted an item thinking I could drag and drop the item to record it again. But when I tried to drag and drop it back in, it would

### Home icon 27/11
Are you keeping the channel group thing? It does not seem to do anything.

### GitHub free or not? 27/11
Written introduction is confusing on GitHub in my opinion. First it says GitHub support can be purchased in app, then it says it is free.

### Content disappearing 27/11
I had a bunch of links for Librivox books saved in my Great Books channel that are now missing from my tree. I have no idea why they are gone. I did not delete them or move them or do anything with them. They were created a while ago and I just now noticed that they were missing.

Update:

I checked in GitHub and the other items that used to be there in the tree are in GitHub

Maybe I did go into edit mode and move them when I was doing my tutorial video and practicing how to show how to move things. If that is the case, then it could be something to do with the time it takes to save moves made in edit mode? When pressing done maybe that should be a commit button, I do not know if done just closes the edit mode or if it is a save. Maybe that would help save things in edit mode, but I am not sure how you programmed it.

### Folder problems 26/11
Created a folder and tried to move items into it.  
Could not drag and drop items into it.  
So tried cut and paste.  
The items seemed to cut and paste into the folder, but then.  
Strange things happened such as duplicate files created.  
Expanding and contracting caused extra copies to appear or disappear.  
Tried to delete extra copies and wrong files got deleted.  
Tried to copy and paste instead and that did not work either.  
I lost some files so    
Then I just decided to cut and paste the items into another track and start over.  
After I copied my items into another track, I just deleted that folder and the   duplicate items.  

Update 27/11:

Okay I am going to try to duplicate what happened:
1. First of all, I am trying to drag and drop items I already created into my Aristotle folder in Edit mode. It does not work. I opened the folder so it has the plus sign, went into edit mode and tried to drag and drop an item into it. The items just move, it does not drop it into the folder.

2. I was able to cut and paste the items into the folder, so I did that for each item. Everything seemed to go okay. But they ended up in reverse order of volume (7-12 became 12-7), so I went into edit mode to move them in the correct number order (7-12). Everything appeared find in the tree. But then when I expanded and contracted the folder, it seemed to go out of order again and each time it opened again, it had replaced an item with the last item on the list (#7) so now I have volume 7, volume 7, volume 10, volume 9, volume 8, volume 7 instead of what I wanted which is the volumes in order 7,8,9,10,11,12 

In other words, I ended up with two volume 7s that had replaced volumes 11 and 12 because I had expanded and contracted the folder twice.

I hope that helps to explain better what happened.

(1-6 got deleted in my first attempt as mentioned before, I have not replaced them yet)

Maybe make changes moves, cuts and edits only available in edit mode and have a save button instead of a done button?

### Kobble Base Tracks Issue 26/11
I tried to tap open the items, content flashed on the Kobble view, but then disappeared. After several attempts at tapping, the information finally appeared.
***

### Tutorial needs updating 26/11
The tutorial slide show under your kobble base tracks has old information such as creating a channel or track using : instead of +
***

### Home Page 26/11
The home page no longer appears when I open Kobble... the one with the video and short intro that you did.

Update: it seems to be there now, I don’t know why that happened before. I think before when I closed all my tabs maybe I had accidentally closed it as a tab?

Update: I was able to close the intro page as a tab. Maybe that should actually be in the Kobble base tracks in case somebody accidentally does that.

### Character Issue in Markdown 26/11
The single quotation appears as a wrong character so you cannot type contractions like don’t and can’t.
***


### Moved item disappeared 26/11
I had moved an item into a different track. The next time I opened the destination track the new item that I had moved there was missing. I do not know why. It was an old Presentation I had done for Catholic Place.
***

### Kobble failure/closure 26/11
After moving a track, kobble closed for some reason. After I opened it again, the kobble introductory page that I thought I was missing re-appeared. Maybe the Intro page is not in the Base tracks?
***


### Editing Markdown of Shared items? 26/11
I noticed that I could edit the intro page in markdown. It probably should not be that way... or what happens if somebody edits the Markdown of a shared item?
