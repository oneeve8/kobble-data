### Content disappearing 27/11
I had a bunch of links for Librivox books saved in my Great Books channel that are now missing. I have no idea why they are gone. I did not delete them or move them or do anything with them. They were created a while ago and I just now noticed that they were missing.

### Folder problems 26/11
Created a folder and tried to move items into it.  
Could not drag and drop items into it.  
So tried cut and paste.  
The items seemed to cut and paste into the folder, but then.  
Strange things happened such as duplicate files created.  
Expanding and contracting caused extra copies to appear or disappear.  
Tried to delete extra copies and wrong files got deleted.  
Tried to copy and paste instead and that did not work either.  
I lost some files so    
Then I just decided to cut and paste the items into another track and start over.  
After I copied my items into another track, I just deleted that folder and the   duplicate items.

### Kobble Base Tracks Issue 26/11
I tried to tap open the items, content flashed on the Kobble view, but then disappeared. After several attempts at tapping, the information finally appeared.

### Tutorial needs updating 26/11
The tutorial slide show under your kobble base tracks has old information such as creating a channel or track using : instead of +

### Home Page 26/11
The home page no longer appears when I open Kobble... the one with the video and short intro that you did.

### Character Issue in Markdown 26/11
The single quotation appears as a wrong character so you cannot type contractions like don’t and can’t.

### Moved item disappeared 26/11
I had moved an item into a different track. The next time I opened the destination track the new item that I had moved there was missing. I do not know why. It was an old Presentation I had done for Catholic Place.

### Kobble failure/closure 26/11
After moving a track, kobble closed for some reason. After I opened it again, the kobble introductory page that I thought I was missing re-appeared. Maybe the Intro page is not in the Base tracks?

### Editing Markdown of Shared items? 26/11
I noticed that I could edit the intro page in markdown. It probably should not be that way... or what happens if somebody edits the Markdown of a shared item?
