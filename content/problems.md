## Problems Found

### Folder problems
Created a folder and tried to move items into it.  
Could not drag and drop items into it.  
So tried cut and paste.  
The items seemed to cut and paste into the folder, but then.  
Strange things happened such as duplicate files created.  
Expanding and contracting caused extra copies to appear or disappear.  
Tried to delete extra copies and wrong files got deleted.  
Tried to copy and paste instead and that did not work either.  
I lost some files so    
Then I just decided to cut and paste the items into another track and start over.  
After I copied my items into another track, I just deleted that folder and the   duplicate items.  

### Kobble Base Tracks Issue
I tried to tap open the items, content flashed on the Kobble view, but then disappeared. After several attempts at tapping, the information finally appeared.

### Tutorial needs updating
The tutorial slide show has old information such as creating a channel or track using : instead of +

### Home Page
The home page no longer appears when I open Kobble... the one with the video and short intro that you did.

### Character Issue in Markdown
The single quotation appears as a wrong character so you can’t type contractions like don’t and can’t.

### Moved item disappeared
I had moved an item into a different track. The next time I opened the destination track the new item that I had moved there was missing. I don’t know why. It was an old Presentation I had done for Catholic Place.
