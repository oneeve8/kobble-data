You will also learn how to retrieve information from your GitHub account.

I’ll also share some ideas for creating your own wiki knowledge base, as well as some content management ideas.

And finally, I’ll give you a quick review.

Let’s get started.

***

To share a track or channel, simply long tap it, 

select *share* and select the medium you want to share it in. 

You can send a message or an email, or save it to your own notes or files.

I’m selecting mail,  

A pop up window will open and then you can enter the email address you wish to send it to.

Another way to share your channels and tracks is to create your own *Follow Me* Markdown file.

Just create a Markdown file with a list of all the channels that you want to share with their links.

Then share that channel

When the recipient follows your shared channel

they can simply drag and drop any links that you shared into their own Kobble tree.

Your recipients will receive all your updates of your channels as you update.

***

To stream an archived book, first find the archived book that you want to stream. 

Drag and drop the URL into your Kobble tree.

The name and subtitle will be automatically updated.

But you may want to change it.

Long tap the newly created link and tap edit.

Edit your title and subtitle as needed.

Check the link, if the link says stream, it will stream just fine in Kobble.

This archived book link needs to be changed from *details* to *stream*

Now you can read your archived book in your Kobble view and take notes while you read.

Here is an archived book link that already contains the word *stream* in the link.

Just create a Markdown file for your notes and tap the tab whenever you want to take a note.
