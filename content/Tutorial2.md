In this tutorial video

You will learn how to stream an archived book

You will also learn some basic Markdown syntax, including:

1. How to add an inline link

2. How to add an image

3. And how to add a video to a Markdown file

After showing you some tips on Markdown, 

I’ll give you a quick review of the features in Kobble.

I’ll also share some ideas for creating your own wiki knowledge base, as well as some content management ideas.

Finally, If you opted for GitHub support, you will be interested in learning how to share a channel or track.

I’ll show you how.

So, Let’s get started.

***

First I’ll show you how to stream a book in your kobble view.

To stream an archived book, first find the archived book that you want to stream. 

Drag and drop the URL into your Kobble tree.

The name and subtitle will be automatically updated.

But you may want to change it.

Long tap the newly created link and tap edit.

Edit your title and subtitle as needed.

Check the link, if the link has the word stream, it will stream just fine in Kobble.

This archived book link needs to be changed from *details* to *stream*

Now you can read your archived book in your Kobble view.

Here is a text archived book link that already contains the word *stream* in the link.

Now, if you want to, you can create a Markdown file for your notes and tap your note tab whenever you want to take a note while you read.

***

Next I’ll show you some Markdown syntax

To create headings use the hashtag symbol

The more hashtags you use, the smaller your heading.

To create a hard break, use return twice

To create a soft break, use at least two spaces after your punctuation in a line.  

To italicise, use an asterisk before and after the word you want to italicise.

To boldface your word, use two asterisks before and after the word you want bolded.

To create a division line use three asterisks.

***
To add a link, use the brackets before and after the word or words that will serve as your link, then paste the URL in parentheses

Next I’ll show you how to add an image or video to a Markdown file.

To add an image, the Markdown syntax is an exclamation point,

followed by brackets with the image description, 

followed by parentheses with the image URL.

***

To add a video, the Markdown syntax is 

brackets with the video description, 

followed by the video embed URL in parenthesis. 

For example, in youtube, you can find the video embed URL under the share icon when you select embed code.

***

Don’t worry, if you forget, you can always refer to our Markdown cheat sheet 

If you are new to Markdown, no worries, it’s very easy to learn.

Now Lets review some of the features in Kobble. 

Lets first review the tree on the left side of your screen:

A green channel is your own content.  
A white channel is a channel that was shared by someone else.  

Tap the white plus sign next to Channels to create a new Channel.

The green plus symbol next to your own channels or tracks indicates that your channel or track is open.   

If there is no plus sign, then it’s closed.  Simply tap again to toggle it.

In order to delete a channel while in edit mode, it must be closed.  
In order to move content into a channel while in edit mode, it must be opened.  

A long Tap reveals the options to cut, copy, edit, or share.  

A Track has a green train track icon.  

Next to each item, you will see other icons.

The Presentation icon is a presentation screen,   
The Markdown icon is the letter M,  
And the Link icon is a chain link.  
You can open the link in your Kobble view by tapping it
Or
You will notice another icon on the right of square and an up arrow,  
tapping that opens your link in a new window.  
Another icon is a folder.
Tapping the folder will open or close it. The folder must be open in order to move content into it.  

On top of your Kobble tree you will see the word Edit.  
Tap Edit to move or delete channels, tracks or items.

In edit mode, the red circle is your delete button,  
to confirm your delete, after your tap,  
the item will slide to the left to reveal another red delete.  
Tap that to delete it.

On the right side of your tree items in edit mode   
you will notice a triple bar.  
Tap, hold and drag the triple bar to move a channel track or item.

The House icon on the top right of your kobble tree contains your GitHub access information.

***
Now let’s take a look at your main window.

In the main window is your
Kobble view
On the top right are the words *close tab*   
tap that to close the tab which is highlighted in green below.
The tab bar shows you all the items you have open.  
The green bar below the heading of the tab indicates which tab you are currently viewing.  
You will notice that the tab bar can be scrolled left or right.  

Now if you are viewing a Markdown file in your Kobble view,
You will notice a pencil icon below the tab bar on the left

To edit a Markdown file, tap the pencil icon
You can view your results in the bottom half of your split screen view or
Tap the square view icon to toggle the split screen view away.

If you’ve watched some of our introductory videos, 

by now, you probably have lots of ideas about how you want to use Kobble.

You might just want to do something as simple as keeping all your internet bookmarks organised.

You may want to organise and manage other kinds of content, such as projects and to do lists.

You may want to keep track of work related information; or personal information.

If you are a student, you may want to keep track of your study notes, or even create a presentation that you could use as flash cards for memorising. You could create reports or a slide show for a speech presentation.

If you are a teacher, you could create a whole study unit on a particular topic with information that you want your students to read and learn. You could put your lecture notes on a slide presentation.

Or, if you are the type of person who just likes to collect all kinds of information, you may even want to create your own personalised knowledge base wiki.

With your free Kobble app, all of your Kobble information is stored on your own personal computer. 

If you plan on creating, storing, and sharing a lot of information, you will want to activate a GitHub account. 

So lets talk about GitHub

If you are not familiar with GitHub, it is basically a web based repository and internet hosting service. 

It has mostly been used for code for developers

Because it allows for version control easy collaboration between developers

But actually, GitHub is not just for developers.

Some people have been using it for word document version controls because each project has its own repository and a unique URL, so you can keep a version history.

One of the things people want most, is control over their own data. Since GitHub has been used by developers, you can have complete confidence that your data is secure. GitHub is reliable and allows you to stay in control. 

A public GitHub account is free. This means that your information would be publicly available for anyone to find; and would be easily accessible if you shared your repository URL with others.

There is a small charge for a private GitHub account. A private account keeps all your information private unless you permit others to access your information (by sharing your repository URL?)

The sharing feature in Kobble is activated when you have either a private? or public GitHub account. 

So if you plan on sharing your information, you will need to create a GitHub account.

***

So next I’ll show you how to share your information with others if you have a GitHub account.

To share a track or channel, simply long tap it, 

select *share* and select the medium you want to share it in. 

You can send a message or an email, or save it to your own notes or files.

I’m selecting mail,  

A pop up window will open with your GitHub repo URL.

You can then simply enter the email address of another Kobble user that you wish to share it with and send your message.

***

Another way to share your channels and tracks is to create your own *Follow Me* Markdown file.

Just create a Markdown file with a list of all the channels that you want to share and include their links.

Then share your *Follow Me* channel that you just created.

When the recipient follows you,

They can simply drag and drop any channel or track links that you shared into their own Kobble tree if they want to.

You can continually add new channels and tracks to your own *Follow Me* Markdown file, and your recipients will always have your latest updates.

Your recipients will be able to view all your updates of information within each of your channels and tracks that you shared... as you update them. So you can share information even if it is a work in progress, they will be able to view your most recent updates automatically.
