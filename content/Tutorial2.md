In this tutorial video

You will learn how to stream an archived book

You will also learn how to share a channel or track

You will learn some basic Markdown syntax, including:

1. How to add an image to a Markdown File,

2. And how to add a video to a Markdown File.  

I’ll also share some ideas for creating your own wiki knowledge base, as well as some content management ideas.

Then I’ll give you a quick review of the features in Kobble.

Finally, If you opted for GitHub support, I will briefly show you a few things about GitHub such as how to retrieve information from your GitHub account.

Let’s get started.

Next I’ll show you how to stream a book in your kobble view.

To stream an archived book, first find the archived book that you want to stream. 

Drag and drop the URL into your Kobble tree.

The name and subtitle will be automatically updated.

But you may want to change it.

Long tap the newly created link and tap edit.

Edit your title and subtitle as needed.

Check the link, if the link says stream, it will stream just fine in Kobble.

This archived book link needs to be changed from *details* to *stream*

Now you can read your archived book in your Kobble view.

This is an archived book link that already contains the word *stream* in the link.

Now, if you want to, you can create a Markdown file for your notes and tap your note tab whenever you want to take a note while you read.
***

To share a track or channel, simply long tap it, 

select *share* and select the medium you want to share it in. 

You can send a message or an email, or save it to your own notes or files.

I’m selecting mail,  

A pop up window will open and then you can enter the email address you wish to send it to.

***

Another way to share your channels and tracks is to create your own *Follow Me* Markdown file.

Just create a Markdown file with a list of all the channels that you want to share and include their links.

Then share your *Follow Me* channel that you just created.

When the recipient follows you,

They can simply drag and drop any channel or track links that you shared into their own Kobble tree if they want to.

You can continually add new channels and tracks to your own *Follow Me* Markdown file, and your recipients will always have your latest updates.

Your recipients will be able to view all your updates of information within each of your channels and tracks that you shared... as you update them. So you can share information even if it is a work in progress, they will be able to view your most recent updates automatically.

Next I’ll show you how to add an image or video to a Markdown file.

To add an image, the Markdown syntax is an exclamation point,

followed by brackets with the image description, 

followed by parentheses with the image URL.

***

To add a video, the Markdown syntax is 

brackets with the video description, 

followed by the video embed URL in parenthesis. 

For example, in youtube, you can find the video embed URL under the share icon when you select embed code.

***

Don’t worry, if you forget, you can always refer to our Markdown cheat sheet 

If you are new to Markdown, no worries, it’s very easy to learn.

If you’ve watched some of our introductory videos, by now, you probably have lots of ideas about how you want to use Kobble.

You might just want to keep all your internet bookmarks organised.

Or you may want to keep track of work related information.

If you are a student, you may want to keep track of your
