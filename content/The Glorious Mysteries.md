##### The Apostles' Creed
I believe in God the Father Almighty,   
Creator of heaven and earth;  
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;   
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died and was buried.  
He descended into hell;  
the third day He rose again from the dead;   
He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God,  
the Father Almighty;  
from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.    

*I believe the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.* 
Amen.

Hallowed be thy name.  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,  
On earth as it is in heaven.

But deliver us from evil.*

##### The Hail Holy Queen

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy,  
our life, our sweetness and our hope.    
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.  
To thee to we send up our sighs,  
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  
Turn, then, most gracious advocate,  
thine eyes of mercy toward us,  
and after this, our exile,  
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.  
Leader: *Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.*  
Response: *That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.*
:::
::: slide
Let us pray.   
O God, Whose Only-Begotten Son,     
by His life, death and resurrection, 
has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life: 
grant, we beseech Thee,   
that by meditating upon these mysteries   
of the most holy Rosary  
of the Blessed Virgin Mary,   
we may imitate what they contain,   
and obtain what they promise,   
through the same Christ our Lord.  

Amen.
